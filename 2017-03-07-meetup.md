# echOpen's organization

The principal project is the **medical probe**.

The project will be cut into releases, each release lasts *n* months and begins by a captech which fixes the objectives (cost, android application, performances, etc.).
During the captech the terms of requirements are written.

To think properly during captech people have to think like they were a "tech" user (such use case with the device), this user generates a client's need.

A new contributor has to know the final objective.


## Teams' jobs

The terms of requirements impose challenges to teams which have to give results in a given time.

A challenge is incident to a team, it has to be cut in small tasks (for the sake of agility).

**A task is validated if  and only if it pass successfully al the associated tests**.

Teams are client of each other, to avoid deadlocks each Monday all the teams have to send an emissary (no matter who he/she is while he/she is member of the team) to inform the other teams about the potentials problem that his/her team meets.

When all challenges are done there is a release to make an assessment (documentation, assessment of the performances, etc.).

**This assessment have to permit to any people to build the device at house**. We  have to give this person some information :

* where to buy components of the product,
* how to link them,
* how to interface the product with the android application,
* how does the application work


## Tools

There will be two documentation's mediums :

* the starter kit which introduces echOpen to any person (what is echOpen ? What is its goal ? What is the last release ? How to contribute ? Which works are in progress , Etc.),
* a guidebook medico-technic which includes documentation of all the release (to have an historic) and a chapter WIP (which includes all the challenges which have to be linked to their githhub's repositories), it contains also a bibliography and the notes of all team


**Slack is not an information medium !** It serves only for communication.


## Bootstrap of echOpen's new organization

Initialization is linked to documentation, we  have to **stop new development and create documentation on all that already exists in echOpen**.

## Others


The WHO (World Health Organization) has a metric to measure the quality of ultrasound picture.

The medical probe has to answer some rules, we have to code by respecting them (@rbo do you know those rules ?).

It must be good to make a state of the art of all existing probes.
A state of the art was done, we must refind it.

The ideas' reflection has not to be included in all releases.
It is very important to have an historic but for new contributor we have to go directly to the essential : **what is currently in progress and how to help**.
